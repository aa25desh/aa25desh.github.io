Julia Season of Contribution​(JSoC) (language Julia)
(Code of Conduct same as Google Summer of Code) (Tasks complete till now)

​​May 2019 - Aug 2019

Implemented ​Range over-approximation algorithm​ which improves Range bounds By 70-95% using TaylorModel to Zonotope conversion.

Developed ​RangeEnclosures.jl​ a Julia Package which bounds polynomials using various methods, which was initiated by my ​PR​ to TaylorModels.jl.

Implemented ​Branch and Bound(BNB)​ and Linearly dominated Bound(LDB) algorithm. BNB can minimise relative precision up to 50% and achieve relative precision [1e-5, 1e-5] in most of the cases. Debugged porting validated_int in TMJets.

Created Proof of Concept for “Domain Contraction Methods” using Interval Constraint Programming.
